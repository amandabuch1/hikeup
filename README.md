# HikeUp

Hiking alone is dangerous and unsafe. HikeUp was designed to make it easy to find people who would like to go on hikes together. Based on their location, a user can post about a hike that they want to go on. Other users will be able to comment and communicate in hopes that they can go on a hike together.

I want to be able to comment on other peopleâ€™s posts and them be able to update their own posts. I also want to work on styling.
